## Task 1: Data Analysis of Supermarket Transactions

### Overview:
I was provided with a **CSV dataset** containing three years of transactional data from Australian supermarkets. The task involved answering the following questions:

1. How many apples were purchased in cash across locations?
2. How much cash was spent on apples?
3. How much money was spent by non-member customers at the Bakershire store?

### Approach:
I used **Excel** to filter the dataset and applied the **SUM** formula to calculate the required values. The data was filtered based on specific criteria (e.g., apples, cash payments, Bakershire store, non-member customers) to get the accurate results.

### Final Output:
The analysis was documented in the file with the formulas used for transparency, and the file was submitted for review.
